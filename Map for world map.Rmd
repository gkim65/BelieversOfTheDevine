This was a practice rmd for the world map leaflet, took many tries to get it fully done but it's here for everyone to enjoy!


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# downloaded our various libraries

library(leaflet)

```


```{r world map data cleaning}

  clean_names()

# added a column to this data that notes which religion is the highest for each country
# saved into a new data set that will have only country names and the religions
world_clean <- world %>% 
  mutate(highest_religion = apply(world[,-(1)],1,which.max)) %>%

# change column names to join with other data set later
