# Believers in the Divine, the religions of South Korea

In this github repository, the format is organized as follows:

1. The shiny app folder: Korea. This folder contains several different files inside:
- The graphics folder, has all the images for my korea geographic maps mapping each religion population density out of the various administrative regions
- The raw-data folder, which gives access to all the different data sources I utilized
- The rds files from the data cleaning rscript, which has all of the cleaned data ready to use for my shiny app
- The shiny app code itself! Please check it out!

2. The various rmd files on the first page 
- These are various practice files for developing the various graphs and visuals within my shiny app. You can try running through each one to see how each of the code works for each graph and visual.

3. Data Cleaning.r
- All of my data wrangling and manipulation processes which saved each of my cleaned data sources into a nice rds file.
